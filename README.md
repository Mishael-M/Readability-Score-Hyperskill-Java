# Readability-Score-Hyperskill-Java
Hyperskill Project found at https://hyperskill.org/projects/39.

The project computes the reading level of text from an input file.

The reading levels are computed by the following algorithms:
* Automated Readability
* Flesh-Kincaid Readability Tests
* Simple Measure of Gobbledygook Index
* Coleman-Liau Index
